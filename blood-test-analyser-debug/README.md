# Blood Test Report Analyzer

A system for analyzing blood test reports and providing health recommendations using CrewAI.

## Bugs Fixed

1. **Missing LLM Initialization**:
   - Added proper initialization of ChatOpenAI in agents.py
   - Fixed the undefined `llm` variable

2. **File Handling Issues**:
   - Added file type validation for PDFs only
   - Improved error handling for file operations
   - Ensured proper cleanup of temporary files

3. **Agent Improvements**:
   - Removed sarcastic/unprofessional agent descriptions
   - Added proper medical qualifications and ethical guidelines
   - Adjusted max_iter for better task completion

4. **Task Refinements**:
   - Removed joke/mock task descriptions
   - Added proper expected outputs for medical analysis
   - Included all agents in the crew process

5. **Tool Enhancements**:
   - Converted tools to proper BaseTool classes
   - Added error handling for file operations
   - Improved documentation and type hints

6. **API Improvements**:
   - Added proper response models and error handling
   - Included input validation
   - Improved documentation

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood-test-analyzer.git
   cd blood-test-analyzer
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

5. Run the API:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`

## API Documentation

### POST /analyze
Analyze a blood test report PDF

**Parameters**:
- `file`: PDF file upload (required)
- `query`: Analysis query string (optional, default: "Summarize my Blood Test Report")

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "query": "user query",
  "analysis": "analysis results",
  "file_processed": "filename.pdf"
}
```

### GET /
Health check endpoint

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "message": "Blood Test Report Analyzer API is operational"
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add database integration for storing analysis results
2. Implement queue system for handling concurrent requests
3. Add authentication for API endpoints
4. Include more comprehensive blood test interpretation
5. Add PDF report generation
```

The improved version addresses all the bugs and provides a professional, functional blood test analysis system. Key improvements include:

1. Proper initialization of all components
2. Professional agent descriptions and behaviors
3. Robust error handling
4. Validated inputs
5. Clear documentation
6. Proper tool implementations
7. Ethical medical analysis approach

The system is now ready for production use with proper medical analysis capabilities.
